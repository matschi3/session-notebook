## How React Renders

React needs to know where to render the elements it creates. We select the DOM element we want to
render into by using `document.querySelector()`. We then create a React root object. The root object
has a `render()` method that we can use to render React elements into the DOM.

```html
<!--html-->
<div id="root"></div>
```

```jsx
// jsx
const rootElement = document.querySelector("#root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>);
```

You'll probably never have to write this code yourself, because it is already included in all
templates and starters. In the real world it usally looks like this:

```jsx
// jsx
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot();

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Here we have an imported `<App />` element that is wrapped in `<React.StrictMode>`.

> ðŸ’¡ `StrictMode` sets up React to run in strict mode. In strict mode React points out potential
> problems in an application.

</summary>

React only updates the DOM elements that have changed compared to the last render. This is very
efficient and provides a great user experience (focus stays consistent, inputs keep their values,
etc.) as well as a great developer experience (declaritive code is much easier to reason about).

## `createButton()` with different `valueTypes` as `props`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button
      color="lightgreen"
      disabled
      isHappy
      text="Ich bin grÃ¼n"
      onButton={() => {
        alert("ouch, you hit me!");
      }}
      value={3} // numbers have to be inside {}
    />
  );
}

function Button({ color, disabled, isHappy, text, onButton, value }) {
  return (
    <button
      style={{ backgroundColor: color }}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={onButton}
    >
      {text}
      <span role="img" aria-label={isHappy ? "happy" : "sad"}>
        {isHappy ? "ðŸ™‚" : "ðŸ˜•"}
      </span>
      Value is {value}
    </button>
  );
}
```
