## How React Renders

React needs to know where to render the elements it creates. We select the DOM element we want to
render into by using `document.querySelector()`. We then create a React root object. The root object
has a `render()` method that we can use to render React elements into the DOM.

```html
<!--html-->
<div id="root"></div>
```

```jsx
// jsx
const rootElement = document.querySelector("#root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>);
```

You'll probably never have to write this code yourself, because it is already included in all
templates and starters. In the real world it usally looks like this:

```jsx
// jsx
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot();

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Here we have an imported `<App />` element that is wrapped in `<React.StrictMode>`.

> ðŸ’¡ `StrictMode` sets up React to run in strict mode. In strict mode React points out potential
> problems in an application.

React only updates the DOM elements that have changed compared to the last render. This is very
efficient and provides a great user experience (focus stays consistent, inputs keep their values,
etc.) as well as a great developer experience (declaritive code is much easier to reason about).

## React Components

React applications are built using components. A component is an independent and reusable piece of the user interface that contains its own structure, logic, and potentially styling.

React components are JavaScript functions that
return React elements. Those elements are then turned into DOM elements by React during the
rendering process.

In order to create a React component, we write a named function (using PascalCase) and have it
return the desired elements using JSX.

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button type="button" className="default-button">
      I'm a button
    </button>
  );
}
```

This is a very powerful concept, because it allows us to reuse the same component in multiple places
in our application.

## `createButton()` with different `valueTypes` as `props`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button
      color="lightgreen"
      disabled
      isHappy
      text="Ich bin grÃ¼n"
      onButton={() => {
        alert("ouch, you hit me!");
      }}
      value={3} // numbers have to be inside {}
    />
  );
}

function Button({ color, disabled, isHappy, text, onButton, value }) {
  return (
    <button
      style={{ backgroundColor: color }}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={onButton}
    >
      {text}
      <span role="img" aria-label={isHappy ? "happy" : "sad"}>
        {isHappy ? "ðŸ™‚" : "ðŸ˜•"}
      </span>
      Value is {value}
    </button>
  );
}
```
