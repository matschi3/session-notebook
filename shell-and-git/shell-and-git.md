-Create a new branch with 'git switch -c <branchname>'.  
-Make changes to the code / write your code fpr the feature.  
-Push the changes and the new branch with 'git push -u origin <branchname>' (after you have done this once you can use git push for this branch)  
-Create a pull request on GitHub from the new branch into main  
-Share the pull request with your team  
-Review the pull request, implement changes if needed, push again to update the pull request until it gets approved  
-Merge the pull request into main  
-Don't forget to git pull inside the main branch on your local machine  
-Delete the new branch on GitHub and locally
